# Documentation: Supplier Management Application

## Overview
The `App.js` file serves as the entry point for a React-based Supplier Management application. It integrates key components and services to provide functionality for managing suppliers. The application is structured to display a supplier list and a form for adding new suppliers.

## Application Logic
The `App.js` file contains the following logic:
- **Rendering the Application**:  
  The `App` function returns a JSX structure that includes:
  - A title (`Supplier Management`).
  - The `SupplierForm` component for adding suppliers.
  - The `SupplierList` component for displaying the list of suppliers.

## Insights
- **Modular Design**:  
  The application is designed with modularity in mind, separating concerns into components (`SupplierForm` and `SupplierList`) and services (`supplierService`).

- **Scalability**:  
  The use of services (`getAllSuppliers` and `createSupplier`) suggests that the application is prepared to handle backend integration, making it scalable for larger datasets or more complex supplier management needs.

- **User Interface**:  
  The application prioritizes user interaction by providing a form for supplier creation and a list for supplier visualization.

- **Business Use Case**:  
  This application is tailored for businesses that need to manage supplier information efficiently, including adding new suppliers and viewing existing ones.
