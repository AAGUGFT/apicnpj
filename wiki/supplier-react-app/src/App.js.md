## Services Used

## Code Logic
### Application Structure
The `App` component is a functional React component that serves as the root of the application. It renders the following:
1. **Header**: Displays the title "Supplier Management".
2. **SupplierForm**: A form for adding new suppliers.
3. **SupplierList**: A list for displaying existing suppliers.

### Code Snippet
```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Supplier Management</h1>
            <SupplierForm />
            <SupplierList />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Insights
- **Component Composition**: The application is modular, with separate components for form handling (`SupplierForm`) and data display (`SupplierList`). This promotes reusability and maintainability.
- **Service Integration**: The use of `getAllSuppliers` and `createSupplier` suggests that the application interacts with a backend or external API for data management.
- **Scalability**: The structure allows for easy addition of new features, such as supplier search or filtering, by extending the `SupplierList` component or adding new services.
- **Styling**: The `className="App"` indicates that CSS styling is applied, though the specific styles are not defined in this file.
