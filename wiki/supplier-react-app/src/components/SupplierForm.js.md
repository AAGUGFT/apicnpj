# SupplierForm Component Documentation

## Overview

The `SupplierForm` component is a React-based form designed to facilitate the creation of supplier records. It includes input fields for supplier details, validation logic for the Brazilian CNPJ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica), and error handling mechanisms. The form interacts with a backend service to save supplier data.

## Features

### Input Fields
The form includes the following fields for supplier information:

- **Telefone Contato**: The phone number of the contact person.

### Validation

### Error Handling

## Functional Flow

### State Management
The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage:
- **Supplier Data**: An object containing the values of the form fields.
- **Error Messages**: A string to display validation or submission errors.

### Event Handlers
- **handleChange**: Updates the state with the value of the input field being modified.
- **handleSubmit**: Validates the form data, checks the CNPJ, and submits the data to the backend service.

### CNPJ Validation Logic
The validation process includes:
1. Removing non-numeric characters.
2. Ensuring the CNPJ has 14 digits.
3. Performing mathematical checks on the digits to verify authenticity.
